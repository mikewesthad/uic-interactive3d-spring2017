    <p>Michael Hadley, mhadley@uic.edu  </p>
    <p>Class: Art 457, Spring 2017<br>Location: 400 S Peoria St, Room 5226<br>Time: Mon &amp; Wed, 4p - 6.40p<br>Office Hours: By Appointment  </p>
    <p>Class website: <a href="https://www.mikewesthad.com/uic-interactive3d-spring2017/">mikewesthad.com/uic-interactive3d-spring2017/</a><br>Class communication: <a href="https://interactive3d-sp2017.slack.com">interactive3d-sp2017.slack.com</a></p>
    <p>This syllabus is a living document - it may be updated over the course the semester.</p>
    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>This is a hands-on class on designing and developing interactive 3D content in <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. Unity is a 3D development tool for creating cross-platform applications (mobile, web and desktop). These applications can be anything: games, medical visualizations, art installations, data visualizations, etc.  </p>
    <p>Creating 3D applications is exciting and challenging because it requires a diverse skillset - everything from programming &amp; math to 3D modeling &amp; texturing. Through lectures, tutorials and exercises, students will develop the multi-disciplinary skillset needed to think and create in 3D. The class will cover: Unity fundamentals, programming in C#, real-time graphics concepts, 3D modeling in Blender &amp; the 3D asset pipeline.</p>
    <h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Understand how 3D graphics are represented and rendered in real-time applications.</li>
    <li>Apply 3D techniques and skills learned in class to make meaningful &amp; creative interactive applications.</li>
    <li>Discuss your work in the wider context of interactive 3D content.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Participate in all class activities especially critiques and discussions. Your active input is essential to creating a supportive community in class.</li>
    <li>Be resourceful and seek out help when needed.</li>
    <li>Be present! Do not surf the web, chat, twitter, facebook, or check email during lectures and discussions.</li>
    <li>Take notes during class. We will be doing a lot of demos and exercises in class that won&#39;t necessarily have slides.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="attendance-participation">Attendance &amp; Participation</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Attendance is mandatory. We have a lot of material to cover and each new concept builds on the last, so missing a class can really set you back.</li>
    <li>Be here and be on time. Showing up more than 15 minutes late or leaving early will count as an absence.</li>
    <li>If you have to miss a class (illness, religious holiday, etc.), let me know as soon as possible. Make sure to check in with you classmates to catch up on material.</li>
    <li>3 or more absences will result in the failure of the class.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
    <p>This class involves a lot of skills. Some of you will come into the class already knowing some areas, and some of you will come in without a background. Your starting knowledge will be taken into account when grading. The most important component of your grade is artistic development over the course of the semester.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>10% active participation in class (critiques, labs, etc.)</li>
    <li>30% homework assignments</li>
    <li>15% midterm project &amp; presentation</li>
    <li>10% final project proposal</li>
    <li>35% final project &amp; presentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Extra credit may be given for work that goes above and beyond the assignment. Late assignments will only be accepted with my permission. You will lose a letter grade for each day the assignment is late.</p>

    <p>Students who wish to observe their religious holidays shall notify the faculty member by the tenth day of the semester of the date when they will be absent unless the religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day of the semester.  In such cases, the student shall notify the faculty member at least five days in advance of the date when he/she will be absent.  The faculty member shall make every reasonable effort to honor the request, not penalize the student for missing the class, and if an examination or project is due during the absence, give the student an exam or assignment equivalent to the one completed by those students in attendance.  If the student feels aggrieved, he/she may request remedy through the campus grievance procedure.</p>
    <h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
